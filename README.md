# About
This repository is a part of my academic thesis project, focused on the topic of "Malicious Ransomware Software for Educational Purposes." The primary objective of this project is to develop a demonstrative application for educational use, showcasing the inner workings of ransomware attacks, with the goal of raising awareness during cybersecurity training sessions.

# Repository Contents
At its core, this repository houses an educational (demonstration) version of ransomware software named "RansomAware," implemented in C/C++. The software is designed for analytical purposes and simulations, and it includes commonly used file encryption practices as well as anti-debugging techniques.

# Key Objectives
- Create an educational tool to illustrate how ransomware operates.
- Promote understanding of ransomware attacks for educational and cybersecurity training.
- Showcase encryption methods and anti-debugging strategies commonly employed by ransomware.
